/**
 * Utility class for handling cooldowns. Cooldowns are stored by key (and optionally by player).
 * The keys are a way of identifying which action to use in the cooldown.
 * When a player performs action A, action B and then action B again, the system needs to be able to differentiate action A and B,
 * since a player can be on cooldown for multiple things.
 * <p>Using the {@link #canPerform(String, long)} or {@link #canPerform(Player, String, long)} methods allows you to check
 * whether a player can perform the action specified in the arguments. These methods return true when the player
 * is allowed to perform the action, and false when the player is not. When the player is allowed to perform the action,
 * the last execution time of the player is automatically updated to now. The {@code cooldown} argument is used to specify
 * the cooldown for the provided key. Code example:</p>
 * <blockquote><code>if (!canPerform(player, "right click wand", 1000)) { return; }</code></blockquote>
 * <p>In the above example, the {@code return} statement will be executed when the player has performed the action {@code "right click wand"}
 * in the last 1000 ms (1 second). If the action was last performed more than 1000 ms ago, the {@code return} statement will not be called.</p>
